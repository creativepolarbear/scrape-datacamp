# Creating the get_response() function

Most of the exercises in this course will call the `chat.completions`
endpoint of the OpenAI API with a user prompt. Here, you will create a
`get_response()` function that receives a prompt as input and returns
the response as an output. You will then use this function to generate a
poem about ChatGPT. In future exercises, this function will be
pre-loaded for you.

Please note that DataCamp does not store keys used in the exercises.

Now you want to use system prompts in order to provide context for the
chatbot about **MyPersonalDelivery** instead of relying on sample

recognizes the context effectively.
